**Constraints**
- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

### Task 2. Leetcode: 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

- You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.  
- Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
- Return the head of the merged linked list.

**Constraints**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
